Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

## Guidelines

- Keep the code simple and explicit
- New functionality should include tests

## Scope

Simplicity and correctness are prioritized over micro-optimizations and clear, readable code is preferred over clever solutions.

That said, **performance improvements are welcome**, as long as they do not significantly reduce clarity or maintainability.
